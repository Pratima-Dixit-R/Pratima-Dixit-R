- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pratima-Dixit-R
- 👀 I’m interested in 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to optimize AI algorithms for bioinformatics applications, leveraging tools like Intel OneAPI for faster and more scalable computations. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI-driven biotech projects, bio-IT innovations, and generative models for healthcare, genomics. If you’re into AI for healthcare or data analytics whether bio data or any relevant other data we should connect!

- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her (skillfully navigating between innovation, collaboration, and elegance)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love writing algorithms that mimic nature’s complexity. It’s like Mother Nature and I are in a coding competition—who can create the best  "tech codes decrypting her complex genomic morse codes"! If you ever want to solve a problem creatively, let’s chat—code and biology can teach us both a thing or two!
